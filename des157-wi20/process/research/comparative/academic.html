                <h2> Food Insecurity, Food Waste, America's Caloric Intake, and the Obesity Epidemic</h2>
                <p>The first TED talk I watched by Clancy Cash Harrisons dives deep into the alarming figures of those
                    facing food insecurity throughout our country. She explains how one in four children do not know
                    where
                    their next meal is coming from, thus impacting their emotional, physical, and mental development.
                    Good
                    nutrition is imperative for a child's growth and without it a variety of complications will arise.
                    As
                    the gap widens between rich and poor in the United States and food prices skyrocket due to climate
                    change,
                    more and more people are unable to afford nutritious food for them and their families. Harrison
                    addresses her misconceptions of poverty after working at a food bank. She thought that those coming
                    to the foodbank where
                    ueducated, lazy, and poor due to generational poverty at the expense of tax payers. In reality 34%
                    of the population has
                    had one spell of poverty lasting 2-3 months, while less than 2-3% lived in chronic poverty
                    throughout a four year study.
                    Many of these people face too much shame to reach out to programs to gain food assistance making
                    their situations even worse.
                    Anyone could end up in a sutation where they would benefit from food assistance, but the negative
                    social stigmas make it hard for
                    those people to except help.

                The second Ted Talk I watched called "Obesity is a National Security Issue" by Lieutenant General Mark Hertling
                dives into the complex issue of obesity in America. Hertling discusses alarming statistics about young men joining the army. 
                He stated, "75% of civilians (18-25 years old) who wanted to join the army were not qualified to do so, the number one reason
                was obesity." Further, out of the 25% that could join, 60% of them could not pass the PT. (1 minute of push ups, sit ups, and one mile run).
                He says that starting in the late 90's majority of elementary through highschools stopped teaching physical education and only five states have mandatory requirements for
                physical education. Further, American diets have changed significantally due to fast food offering "super-sized" meals. American's eat about 30% more calories than in 1983.
                Health issues due to obesity have risen significantally, resulting in bilions of dollars  spent each year reversing the damage done by poor nutrition. 
                Ultimately, due to lack of education on proper nutrition and physical activity Americans are not going to have a healthy and effective society nor military force.

                <p>
                    The last TED Talk I watched was "The Global Food Waste Scandal" by Tristram Stuart digs into the issue of global food waste. American produces 4X's the amount of food needed to 
                    feed its population, exhausting the ecological limits our environment can bear. Due to large manufacturing practices and stingy cosmetic standards, millions of pounds of food go to waste
                    before even leaving the field everyday. Stuart found that 13,000 slices of fresh bread goes to waste every single day in one plant located in the UK.
                    Further, farmders discard 1/3 of their harvest due to aesthetic and cosmetic issues. We do the same with livestock and fish, which is absolutely immoral and wasteful.
                    As you go down the chain to retail and indivuals waste, Stuart found that most people throw food away because it's unappetizing not because it is inedible. Food waste 
                    has immense negative impacts on the environment and also counterintuitive to the amount of families that are food insecure.
