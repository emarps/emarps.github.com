            <h3>Comparative Research: The Nature Conservancy</h3>

            <img src="images/environ.png" alt="image">
            <img src="images/convert.png" alt="image">
            <img src="images/save.png" alt="image">

            <div class="A">
                <p>The Nature Conservancy is a global environmental nonprofit that aims to raise money and educate its
                    users about a variety of global environmental issues. One of the ways they educate their users is
                    through interactive calculators that generate one's carbon footprint per year. The program also
                    allows users to compare their usage to the average usage of people across the united states. The
                    interactions across this website are well designed, easy to use, and easy to follow. The user begins
                    at the “get started” icon and goes through the list including: home, food, shopping, your footprint,
                    and then take action. Throughout each step the user gets to see their results compared to the
                    average. Finally, the user can go through different ways to lessen their carbon footprint and then
                    compute how much money and energy they could save using these alternatives. A successful part of the
                    design are two buttons that change the results from a pie chart to a graph, making it easier for the
                    user to comprehend their results. The biggest design issue I see with this page are three random
                    bars at the bottom of the page stating X tons save, X dollars save, and X upfront cost. This section
                    is not cohesive with the rest of the design and could be incorporated in a more engaging and useful
                    way.</p>
                    <p>While the forms are relatively easy to use, the wording and flow of content isn’t as effortless. For
                    example, the average person is not going to know how much money they spend on natural gas, heating
                    oil, and other fuels a year. I am not sure how this could be made easier for the user, but
                    definitely something to think about. Further, the food section has two buttons that are small and
                    unnoticeable that can be clicked to show “simple” or “advanced” foods. However, the simple foods are
                    pretty much the same as “advanced” so I am not entirely sure what the point of this is.
                </p>
                <p> the concept of having an interactive carbon footprint calculator on a website aimed to gain
                    donation for environmental causes is very smart. While the design of the calculator has a few kink,
                    I feel as though there is a strong underlying layout that could be useful for my own project. I
                    almost feel that the calculator options on this site are too much and could be even more effective
                    with a more direct design that shows clearly your own footprint and then comparees at the end
                    instead of incorporating it at every step.

            <h3>Comparative Research: Food Donation Connection</h3>
            </div>
            <img src="images/donate.png" alt="image">
            <img src="images/form.png" alt="image">
            <img src="images/form2.png" alt="image">

          
                <p>
                    The second website I evaluated called “Food Donation Connection,” aims to connect food services and
                    companies to donation programs. This website is incredibly outdated and could certainly use a
                    renovation considering how incredibly beneficial this service is. The Food Donation Connection
                    program has coordinated over 750 million pounds of quality prepared food from service providers in
                    31 countries! This is amazing, but their website is poorly organized and designed making the website
                    almost look fake (I wonder if this is a millennial thing?), which would make clients potentially
                    less inclined to reach out. There are interactive elements throughout the website including forms
                    and buttons. However, these elements and even their “call to action” buttons are hard to find, find,
                    and follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest issue with interaction on this website is the registration form to become a part of the
                    program. The first drawback is the large paragraph of text on the page has a shadow making it hard
                    to read. The three boxes on the registration page have no visible buttons to click and don’t change
                    color when the mouse hovers over them. This makes it difficult for the user to know where and what
                    to click. It is useful that ‘donate’ and ‘agency’ are highlighting, so that it is clear which to
                    choose, but ‘continue’ is also highlight making it even more confusing where to click. When the user
                    does choose an option the form that appears is monochromatic which one button highlighted in blue.
                    While there is some hierarchy in the type, the color scheme makes it hard for the eye to go to the
                    right place because everything looks the same. There can be a lot of text removed from this page to
                    be more effective. The most successful interactive aspect of this page is that when you add your
                    email and password, the login button won’t turn green and allow you to click until the correct
                    format of email is typed.
                    <p>
                    Overall, this website's design and interactivity is outdated and doesn't use its forms and buttons
                    efficiently. There are a lot of changes that could be made to enhance the users experience and work
                    better with the content. I am interested in this topic and creating an interactive site or event
                    that could help the issue of food waste.
