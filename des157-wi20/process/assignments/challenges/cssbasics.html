           <h2> Inheritance in CSS</h2>
           <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and 'cascading' is important to understand when working with CSS. 
             Sometimes when working in CSS you'll notice that certain properties aren't working or are applied different
             than what you intended. This is usually because of 'inheritance.' The best way I have seen it described is the 
             following: "Inheritance is a way of propagating property values from parent elements to their children." It gets
             a bit confusing because some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their children and some are not. 
             For example, text-size properties inherited but padding and margins are not.

            <h2> Specificity in CSS</h2>
            <p>Specificity in similar to inheritance in the fact that some rules don't apply to some elements. When there are conflicting CSS rules, 
              the browser will determine what is most specific and therfore is applied. There are different specificity hierarchies including: inline styles, 
              classes, IDs, attributes, and psuedo-classes, elements and psuedo-elements. An analogy that helped me understand this concept better is the analogy
              between specificity and Star Wars <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html">(click here for article)</a>.
              Compound selectors can contain moreee than one simple selector while group selectors allow you to group multiple seleectors that share the same
              deeclaration which helps considate your stylesheet.

           <h2> ID and Class Attributes</h2>
         <p> The biggest difference between an ID and a Class Attribute is that classes can be used multiple times while an ID can only be 
           used once. This makes a difference when styling, if you want to style multiple sections the same then you would use a class attribute. 
           An ID attribute specifies a unqique eleement that can only be used once on each page with that ID.
