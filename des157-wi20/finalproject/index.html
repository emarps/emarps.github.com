                <h1>FOOD INSECURITY</h1>
                <p>A person that is food insecure is someone in the state of being without reliable access to a
                    sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. There are two levels of food insecurity: low and
                    very low. Someone facing low food security does not have access to high quality food, but generally
                    has enough food. Someone who has very low food security is one who eats less because they don’t know
                    when they’ll have access to food next and often don’t know where or when their next meal will be.
                    There are a variety of reasons people face food insecurity including: where someone lives,
                    employment and employment opportunities, cost of living, disabilities, unexpected medical emergency,
                    and many more.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Children are more likely to face food insecurity than any other group in the United States. This is
                    also the group that is affected the most physically, emotionally, and psychologically. Children
                    facing food insecurity are significantly more at risk for getting sick and contracting diseases and
                    also face major difficulties concentrating in school. Further, all those who are food insecure have
                    a high risk of getting chronic diseases, like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. Another high risk
                    factor, that seems counter intuitive, is obesity.

                <h1>OBESITY EPIDEMIC</h1>
                <p>Rising obesity in the United States is a public health crises that cannot be ignored as obesity
                    rates skyrocket. The sharp increase in obesity rates has created a cause for concern affecting
                    people of all socioeconomic status. Obesity has been linked to a wide variety of chronic
                    diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and cancer.
                    Data published by JAMA in 2018 found that an astounding 40% of all adults over the age of 20 are
                    currently obese. This amounts to about 93.3 million people facing obesity in the United States.
                    <br> <br> <br>
                    What is making America obese? Too much food and not enough exercise. The average adult is eating
                    about 300 more calories a day than in the 1970’s and the calories they are consuming are higher
                    in saturated fat and high fructose corn syrup. Highly processed foods are readily available,
                    generally cheap, and fully prepared making it easy for Americans to justify. While current
                    social media trends could suggest that people have more access to communities and information
                    about healthy eating habits, it is projected that in 10 years one in four Americans will be
                    “severely obese” or over 100 pounds overweight.

                        <h1>FOOD WASTE</h1>
                        <p>The United States wastes an incomprehensible amount of food every single day. In fact, it is
                            estimated that 30-40% of the food supply is wasted and an astonishing 50% of all produce in
                            the United States is thrown away. Further, food occupies the most room in our landfills
                            which leads to heavier garbage trucks that then use more gas to transport waste, ultimately
                            having a higher impact on the environment. Americans don’t set out to waste food, but
                            instead are conditioned to seek out the freshest, most aesthetically appealing fruit,
                            vegetables, and meat. American’s don’t like to buy “ugly” food and therefore perfectly
                            nutritious food is being wasted on the daily. Before fruit, vegetables, and meat is even
                            sent to grocery stores, a mass amount is discarded due to the premise that people won’t buy
                            it due its imperfections.
                            <br> <br> <br>
                            These staggering numbers are interesting considering the amount of people who are food
                            insecure in America. An incredible 30 billion pounds of food is wasted by supermarkets and
                            grocery stores every year and 54 billion by households. While 37 million Americans don’t
                            know where their next meal is coming from.
